Belly_Button_Biodiversity dashboard

## Objective

Enable project volunteers the ability to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel and f they can sell their bacteria to Improbable Beef.
