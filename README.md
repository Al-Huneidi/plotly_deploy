Belly_Button_Biodiversity Dashboard

## Objective

Created a dashboard for the researchers and the volunteers to easily and quickly access the bacteria species collected from each volunteer.  Each volunteer provided samples of the bacteria in their navel as a certain bacteria has been found to taste like beef.  A start-up, Improbable Beef, is interested in using this bacteria that tastes like beef for their synthetic beef product.

Each volunteer was issued an ID for anonimity.  A dropdown menu is included from which the volunteers can select their ID to see which bacteria and how many they have in their navels.  The charts provide a visual of the amount of bacteria and when hovered over various parts of either the bar or bubble chart, the list of bacteria show. If a volunteer has a large enough quantity of the bacteria Improbable Beef os looking for, they can sell their bacteria to Improbable Beef.
